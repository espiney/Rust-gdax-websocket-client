# Rust-gdax-websocket-client
A rust client for the GDAX websocket system to convert it to a less cpu intensive format

This application sets up its own user based nginx (on port 8080) as well as redis (unix socket only)

Simply running launch.pl in the same directory as this readme should automatically start the application
or alternatively tell you what is missing from your setup.
